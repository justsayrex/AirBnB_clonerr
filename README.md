# AirBnB_clone

## Description
This team project is part of the ALX Africa's Full-Stack Software Engineering program. 
It's the first step towards building a full web application: an AirBnB clone. 
This first step consists of a custom command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## How-To-Use
The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

## Tests
All the code is tested with the **unittest** module.
The test for the classes are in the [test_models](./tests/test_models/) folder.

## Models
The folder [models](./models/) contains all the classes used in this project.
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

## Commands
* Run console: `./console.py`
* Quit: `quit` or `EOF`
* Help: `help` or `help <command>`
* Create an object: `create <class name>`
